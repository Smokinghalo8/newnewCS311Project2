Heuristic Eval:

Visibility of System Status is Horrendous, it tells you barely anything about any ongoing process, except for the "knowledge score changing when you click a button!"
Could use major improvments.

Error Prevention is really good, considering that all the buttons do something and they don't break. Nice job!
